Business Plan: Creohub
1. Executive Summary
Creohub is a creator commerce platform that enables digital entrepreneurs, influencers, educators, and artists to easily create a personalized storefront to sell digital products, physical merchandise, services, or memberships — all from one link. Our platform supports seamless payment integrations including local options like M-Pesa alongside global processors such as PayPal and card payments.

Starting in Kenya, Creohub will address the underserved creator economy in Africa, with plans to scale globally, supporting multilingual interfaces, global shipping tools, and integrated analytics.

2. Problem Statement
African creators lack localized, easy-to-use storefront platforms that support M-Pesa and card payments.

Bio link tools are often limited to display, not monetization.

Existing global tools (like Stan Store or Gumroad) don’t support local payment systems, tax models, or physical + digital product combos for African sellers.

3. Solution: What is Creohub?
A mobile-first platform for creators to:

✅ Create a storefront (hosted and customizable)
✅ Upload and sell:
    - Digital products (eBooks, courses, files)
    - Bookings (consultations, training)
    - Subscriptions (memberships, tips)
    - Physical products (merchandise, dropshipping)
✅ Accept local + global payments
✅ Get sales insights, email capture, and customer CRM tools
✅ Share their store through a single link in bio
