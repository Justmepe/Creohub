   - Complete business verification
   - Generate API credentials

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```env

   - Callback URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/customer/pesapal/callback`

### Credential Validation

Current status: The provided credentials are returning "invalid_consumer_key_or_secret_provided" from Pesapal's API, indicating they need to be updated with valid keys from your Pesapal developer account.

## Payment Flow Architecture

1. **Customer Selection**: User selects Pesapal payment method
2. **Form Submission**: Customer details collected and validated
3. **API Request**: Payment request sent to Pesapal with order details
4. **Authentication**: System authenticates with Pesapal using credentials
5. **Redirect**: Customer redirected to Pesapal hosted payment page
6. **Payment Processing**: Customer completes payment using preferred method
7. **Notifications**: Real-time updates via IPN webhooks
8. **Completion**: Customer redirected to success/failure page

## Security Features

- **Data Validation**: All payment data validated before API calls
- **Secure Redirects**: Callback URLs verified and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses without exposing sensitive data
- **Token Authentication**: API requests require valid user tokens
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Payment URLs use secure protocols

## Integration Benefits

- **Unified Gateway**: Single integration supporting multiple payment methods
- **Regional Optimization**: Prioritizes mobile money for African users
- **Fallback Options**: Multiple payment methods ensure transaction success
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate payment confirmation and status tracking
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for mobile money and phone-based payments

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain Valid Credentials**: Register with Pesapal and generate API keys
2. **Update Configuration**: Replace placeholder credentials with valid ones
3. **Test Payments**: Process test transactions in sandbox environment
4. **Go Live**: Switch to production credentials when ready

The payment infrastructure is complete and ready for live transactions once valid Pesapal credentials are configured.
