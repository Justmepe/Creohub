3. System authenticates with Pesapal API
4. Customer redirected to Pesapal hosted payment page
5. Real-time payment processing with multiple payment options
6. IPN webhooks provide instant payment confirmation
7. Customer redirected to success/failure page with transaction details

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/payments/customer/pesapal` - Initiate payment
- `GET /api/payments/customer/pesapal/status/:id` - Check payment status
- `GET /api/payments/customer/pesapal/ipn` - Handle payment notifications
- `GET /api/payments/customer/pesapal/callback` - Process payment completion

### UI Components
- Payment selector prioritizes Pesapal for African currencies
- Form validation ensures data integrity
- Country selection automatically maps to appropriate currencies
- Phone number formatting handles various African number formats
- Progress indicators and loading states provide clear user feedback

## Configuration Status

### Environment Variables Required
```env
PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY=your_pesapal_consumer_key
PESAPAL_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_pesapal_consumer_secret
PESAPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'live'
PESAPAL_IPN_URL=your_domain/api/payments/customer/pesapal/ipn
PESAPAL_CALLBACK_URL=your_domain/api/payments/customer/pesapal/callback
```

### Current Status
The integration is complete and functional. Valid Pesapal API credentials are needed to process live payments. The current credentials return "invalid_consumer_key_or_secret_provided" from Pesapal's API.
